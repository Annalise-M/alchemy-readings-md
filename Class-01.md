## Domain Name System

(DNS) can be hosted anywhere in the world.

ISP (Internet Service Provider) DSN - acts like a telephone book; it tells your computer the IP address of that domain name.

## Structure

The structure is very much like writing an essay. You have headers, fonts, paragraphs, spacing etc.

Below are some examples of this:

<title></title> tag that will appear at the very top of the ### title bar or ### tabs at the top of the browser window.
To look into how others are building their websites, you can go to the page and look for the ### View menu in yoru browser. Then select the option that says ### Source or ### View Source (the location may vary depending on the browser being used.)

##  Extra Make Up

* Learning the different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version being used
* How to add comment to your code
* Global attributes - used on any element, including ### class and ### id attributes
* Elements that are used to group together parts of the page (where no other element is suitable)
* Embedding a page within a page using ### iframes
* How to add info about the web page using the ### <meta> element
* Adding characters such as angled brackets <> and copyright symbols 
   &copy; or &#169;
The evolution of HTML: HTML 4 ===> XHTML 1.0 ===> HTML 5 (work in progress) each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last.

## ID Attribute

the id attribute is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
It's value should start with a ### letter or an ### underscore (not a number or any other character)
Class Attribute -this helps you identify different elements on the page. It can distinguish and emphasize different parts of your content.

Please see below for examples:

- an element that allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. ex:
Anish Kapoor
Home
Biography
Works
Contact
Objects and Methods ex. document.write('Good afternoon');
In this example, the

### document object represents the entire web page. 

### . (the period) 
- is the member operator. You can access the members of an object using a dot between the object name and the member you want to access. 

### Method 
- in this example is the ### write() method of the ### document object allow new content to be written into the page where the <script> element sits.

### Parameters 
- the 'Good afternoon' in this example. Whenever a method requires some information in order to work, the data is given inside the parentheses (). Each piece of information is called a parameter of the method. In this case, the ### write() method needs to know what to write into the page.
