### hook rules

        Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

        Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function. By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.

### 10 essential react hooks
1. useArray hook - reduces this burden by providing us with various array manipulation methods.
        
        yarn add react-hanger 
        
        import {useArray} from 'react-hanger'

2. react-use-form-state hook - a small React Hook that attempts to simplify managing form state, using the native form input elements you are familiar with.
                
        npm i react-use-form-state
        
3. react-fetch-hook - 
        the most basic and most performed task for a frontend developer.
                
        npm i react-fetch-hook
            
4. useMedia hook - 
        a React sensor hook that tracks the state of a CSS media query. 

5. react-useportal hook - 
        React Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. And this hook helps us do that.
                
        yarn add react-useportal

6. react-firebase-hooks - 
        The useAuthState hook, can be used for authentication. The hook wraps around the firebase.auth().onAuthStateChange() method to ensure that it is always up to date.
        ie. Parameters: auth: firebase.auth.Auth
        Returns: AuthStateHook containing -
        initialising: If the listener is still waiting for the user to be loaded
        user: The firebase.User, or null, if no user is logged in

        npm i react-firebase-hooks

7. use-onClickOutside hook -
        An outside click is a way to know if the user clicks everything but a specific component. You may have seen this behavior when opening a dropdown menu or a modal or a dropdown list.

8. useIntersectionObserver hook - 
        for using intersection observers.
        The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document’s viewport.

        npm i react-use-intersection-observer

9. use-location hook -
        this hook is used for getting the location of the browser.

10. use-redux hook -
        This hook returns the store and dispatch property.

        yarn add use-redux
