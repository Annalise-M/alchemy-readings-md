Career-Track 01 Reading Notes: 

Promise:

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

(promises that your code either does what its meant to do or it fails completely)

---

Destructuring:
 is a JS expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables

(a means of extracting values & properties from arrays and objects)


---
Spread:

- allows us to expand an array expression or string in places where zero or m more arguments (function calls) or elements (array literals) are expected (same with key-value pairs). 

---
Rest:

- allow us to represent an indefinite number arguments as an array.
