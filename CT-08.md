--- Architectural Styles & Architectural Patterns
        In software engineering, an Architectural Pattern is a general and reusable solution to an occurring problem in a particular context. It is a recurring solution to a recurring problem.

        The purpose of Architectural Patterns is to understand how the major parts of the system fit together and how messages and data flow through the system.

--- Container and Presentation Pattern
        Container components “[a]re concerned with how things work”1. In this role they manage state, fetch data from APIs, setup event handlers, and pass information to other components via props.

        (see link for details)

--- Container Details
        Container components are responsible for specifying how a section of our application works. They manage state, fetch data from apis, and setup event handlers.

        (see link for details)

--- Presentation Details
        Presentation components are responsible for specifying how a section of our page looks. They create DOM and styles.

        (see link for details)

--- functional vs class components
        The most obvious one difference is the syntax. A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function which accepts props as an argument and returns a React element.

        A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element. This requires more code but will also give you some benefits which you will see later on.

        (see link for details)

--- Conditional Rendering
        In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

        Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
