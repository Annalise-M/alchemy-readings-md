    Understanding react setstate
        setState() - 
        Update to a component state should be done using setState()

        You can pass an object or a function to setState()

        Pass a function when you can to update state multiple times

        Do not depend on this.state immediately after calling setState() and make use of the updater function instead.

    Lists and Keys -
        builds collections of elements  (including elements in JSX)
        - when using can set an array and loop with .map
        - by using a key, it can render elements from within a component

        (see link for more detail)
---
    Typechecking with PropTypes -
         React has some built-in typechecking abilities. To run typechecking on the props for a component, you can assign the special propTypes property.

---
    Components and Props -
        Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components.

---
    Handling Events -
        React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
        
        With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

        Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.

---
    Snapshot Testing with Jest -
        Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

        A typical snapshot test case renders a UI component, takes a snapshot, then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected, or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.
