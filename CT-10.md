        Hooks
                (Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.)
                
                * Backwards Compatible

                A Hook is called inside a function component to add some local state to it. Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks (JavaScript functions)use react directly.

                You can only call Parent Hooks (original function) but can't call Hooks in nested functions, conditions or loops.
                Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. 

                We want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don’t require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them
                The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components
