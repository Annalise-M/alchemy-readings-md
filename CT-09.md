        MVC
                Model-view-controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

                Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications.

        - Model
                The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

        - View
                Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

        - Controller 
                Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
                In addition to dividing the application into these components, the model–view–controller design defines the interactions between them.

        React MVC
                Model View Controller (MVC) is separating presentation from domain. Why is that important to do? Our application’s “domain” is where we model our perception of the problem and its solution. By making this code separate—without reference to any UI—it could be modeled more correctly, tested more deeply, and presented more numerously.

                Defined it more similarly to the broader concept of a “data model”: a construct to contain your domain-specific data and logic. Ideally, a model would have no idea a UI even existed. For our purposes, don’t think of a model as “an instance of a class inheriting from a Model object” but rather “a collection of functions and objects that are specific to my app’s domain.”

        Implementing MVC Patterns in React:
                1. A Presentation Layer of Controller and View React Components
                2. A UI-Agnostic Data Model

        Reconciliation
                React provides a declarative API so that you don’t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update. This makes writing applications a lot easier, but it might not be obvious how this is implemented within React.
        
                If we used this in React, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
                Two elements of different types will produce different trees.
                The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.
                In practice, these assumptions are valid for almost all practical use cases.

        The Diffing Algorithm
                When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements.
