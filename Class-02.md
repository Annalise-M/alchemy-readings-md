    A good brush up on statements, comments, variables, data types, variables storing numbers, etc. 

    I found the shorthand variable section really helpful. 

    ex.

    Variables: 
        var = 
        const = 
        let =

    Arrays: [ ]
    String ('', " ")
    Boolean (true / false statements)    
    Arithmatic: (math functions ie. + , - , / , % , etc.)

    The comparing operators evaluating conditions: 

    ==       IS equal to 
    !=       is NOT equal to 
    ===      STRICT equal to
    !==      STRICT NOT equal to 
    >        Greater Than
    <        Less Than
    >=       Great Than or Equal to
    <=       Less Than or Equal to
    &&       Logical And
    ||       Logical Or
    !        Logical NOT
