    --- Atomic Design ---
I really enjoyed the atomic design application. It really helped the nature of parent / child dynamics within code (ie. a div within a div).

The atomic design was really helpful in applying the structual break down of building a websites's layout. 

It focused on breaking the structure down by splitting the page design in organisms /larger sections\ and then into smaller components such as, moleules, atom etc. (it was very split and divide, like a mutating organism. Split into larger sections, then divide the organisms into molecules, while extracting the atoms from the molecules.) Very cool stuff.

So best to start wayyyy small and then to build from there!

Thinking in React was a really good article. It was basically the same box breakdown I use when working with CSS layout. 

Focusing on the Single responsibility principle, and if it's any bigger than one task, it needs to be broken down into it own or other Class elements/ functions.

Callbacks -
There's definitely a hierarchy to the design of React js. With call backs they go down the progressed list/ page and will only be executed until the function before it has finished executing. 
Unless setting a function with an asynchronous callback.
